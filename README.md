# jGwentAPI
A Java wrapper library for [GwentAPI](https://gwentapi.com/)

## Libraries
jGwentAPI uses Retrofit along with OkHttp to query [GwentAPI](https://gwentapi.com/).

 ## Status
 This is a current work-in-progress and is not complete or functional at this time.  Currently, only the POJOs are done.

 I've never worked with Retrofit, OkHttp, or even Java 8 so this will be a learning process.
